            <li>On Windows make sure you're using a CSR8510 USB Bluetooth 4.0
            adapter.  You must also make sure the adapter has been changed to use

            <li>On Mac OSX make sure your hardware support Bluetooth LE/4.0, and
            Bluetooth is enabled.</li>
            <li>On Linux make sure you are running as a root user with sudo, that
            you have a Bluetooth LE/4.0 adapter, and have bluez installed.  Also
            ensure noble is using the right Bluetooth adapter by setting the
